# Todo-List
This app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a simple UI and store task data in the browser's LocalStorage — which is a key-value storage system that saves data on the client-side.
It does the following:
-> Add Task – User enters a task in an input field and clicks “Add”.
-> Display Task List – All tasks are shown in a list.
->Delete Task – Each task has a delete button to remove it.
->Mark as Completed – Tasks can be marked done (usually with a strikethrough).
->LocalStorage – Tasks are saved in LocalStorage so they persist after a page reload.
